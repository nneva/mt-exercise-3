What you have told me is quite a romance , a romance of art one might call it , and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic .” “ Harry , don ’ t talk like that .
As long as I live , the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me .
You can ’ t feel what I feel .
You change too often .” “ Ah , my dear Basil , that is exactly why I can feel it .
Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love : it is the faithless who know love ’ s tragedies .” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self - conscious and satisfied air , as if he had summed up the world in a phrase .
There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy , and the blue cloud - shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows .
How pleasant it was in the garden !
And how delightful other people ’ s emotions were !— much more delightful than their ideas , it seemed to him .
One ’ s own soul , and the passions of one ’ s friends — those were the fascinating things in life .
He pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward .
Had he gone to his aunt ’ s , he would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there , and the whole conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model lodging - houses .
Each class would have preached the importance of those virtues , for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives .
The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift , and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour .
It was charming to have escaped all that !
As he thought of his aunt , an idea seemed to strike him .
He turned to Hallward and said , “ My dear fellow , I have just remembered .” “ Remembered what , Harry ?” “ Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray .” “ Where was it ?” asked Hallward , with a slight frown .
“ Don ’ t look so angry , Basil .
It was at my aunt , Lady Agatha ’ s .
She told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her in the East End , and that his name was Dorian Gray .
I am bound to state that she never told me he was good - looking .
Women have no appreciation of good looks ; at least , good women have not .
She said that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature .
I at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair , horribly freckled , and tramping about on huge feet .
I wish I had known it was your friend .” “ I am very glad you didn ’ t , Harry .” “ Why ?” “ I don ’ t want you to meet him .” “ You don ’ t want me to meet him ?” “ No .” “ Mr .
Dorian Gray is in the studio , sir ,” said the butler , coming into the garden .
“ You must introduce me now ,” cried Lord Henry , laughing .
The painter turned to his servant , who stood blinking in the sunlight .
“ Ask Mr . Gray to wait , Parker : I shall be in in a few moments .” The man bowed and went up the walk .
Then he looked at Lord Henry .
“ Dorian Gray is my dearest friend ,” he said .
“ He has a simple and a beautiful nature .
Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him .
Don ’ t spoil him .
Don ’ t try to influence him .
Your influence would be bad .
The world is wide , and has many marvellous people in it .
Don ’ t take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses : my life as an artist depends on him .
Mind , Harry , I trust you .” He spoke very slowly , and the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will .
“ What nonsense you talk !” said Lord Henry , smiling , and taking Hallward by the arm , he almost led him into the house .
CHAPTER II .
As they entered they saw Dorian Gray .
He was seated at the piano , with his back to them , turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann ’ s “ Forest Scenes .” “ You must lend me these , Basil ,” he cried .
“ I want to learn them .
They are perfectly charming .” “ That entirely depends on how you sit to - day , Dorian .” “ Oh , I am tired of sitting , and I don ’ t want a life - sized portrait of myself ,” answered the lad , swinging round on the music - stool in a wilful , petulant manner .
When he caught sight of Lord Henry , a faint blush coloured his cheeks for a moment , and he started up .
“ I beg your pardon , Basil , but I didn ’ t know you had any one with you .” “ This is Lord Henry Wotton , Dorian , an old Oxford friend of mine .
I have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were , and now you have spoiled everything .” “ You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you , Mr . Gray ,” said Lord Henry , stepping forward and extending his hand .
“ My aunt has often spoken to me about you .
You are one of her favourites , and , I am afraid , one of her victims also .” “ I am in Lady Agatha ’ s black books at present ,” answered Dorian with a funny look of penitence .
“ I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday , and I really forgot all about it .
We were to have played a duet together — three duets , I believe .
I don ’ t know what she will say to me .
I am far too frightened to call .” “ Oh , I will make your peace with my aunt .
She is quite devoted to you .
And I don ’ t think it really matters about your not being there .
The audience probably thought it was a duet .
When Aunt Agatha sits down to the piano , she makes quite enough noise for two people .” “ That is very horrid to her , and not very nice to me ,” answered Dorian , laughing .
Lord Henry looked at him .
Yes , he was certainly wonderfully handsome , with his finely curved scarlet lips , his frank blue eyes , his crisp gold hair .
There was something in his face that made one trust him at once .
All the candour of youth was there , as well as all youth ’ s passionate purity .
One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the world .
No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him .
“ You are too charming to go in for philanthropy , Mr . Gray — far too charming .” And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened his cigarette - case .
The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes ready .
He was looking worried , and when he heard Lord Henry ’ s last remark , he glanced at him , hesitated for a moment , and then said , “ Harry , I want to finish this picture to - day .
Would you think it awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away ?” Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray .
“ Am I to go , Mr . Gray ?” he asked .
“ Oh , please don ’ t , Lord Henry .
I see that Basil is in one of his sulky moods , and I can ’ t bear him when he sulks .
Besides , I want you to tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy .” “ I don ’ t know that I shall tell you that , Mr . Gray .
It is so tedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it .
But I certainly shall not run away , now that you have asked me to stop .
You don ’ t really mind , Basil , do you ?
You have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to .” Hallward bit his lip .
“ If Dorian wishes it , of course you must stay .
Dorian ’ s whims are laws to everybody , except himself .” Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves .
“ You are very pressing , Basil , but I am afraid I must go .
I have promised to meet a man at the Orleans .
Good - bye , Mr . Gray .
Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon Street .
I am nearly always at home at five o ’ clock .
Write to me when you are coming .
I should be sorry to miss you .” “ Basil ,” cried Dorian Gray , “ if Lord Henry Wotton goes , I shall go , too .
You never open your lips while you are painting , and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant .
Ask him to stay .
I insist upon it .” “ Stay , Harry , to oblige Dorian , and to oblige me ,” said Hallward , gazing intently at his picture .
“ It is quite true , I never talk when I am working , and never listen either , and it must be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters .
I beg you to stay .” “ But what about my man at the Orleans ?” The painter laughed .
“ I don ’ t think there will be any difficulty about that .
Sit down again , Harry .
And now , Dorian , get up on the platform , and don ’ t move about too much , or pay any attention to what Lord Henry says .
He has a very bad influence over all his friends , with the single exception of myself .” Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek martyr , and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry , to whom he had rather taken a fancy .
He was so unlike Basil .
They made a delightful contrast .
And he had such a beautiful voice .
After a few moments he said to him , “ Have you really a very bad influence , Lord Henry ?
As bad as Basil says ?” “ There is no such thing as a good influence , Mr . Gray .
All influence is immoral — immoral from the scientific point of view .” “ Why ?” “ Because to influence a person is to give him one ’ s own soul .
He does not think his natural thoughts , or burn with his natural passions .
His virtues are not real to him .
His sins , if there are such things as sins , are borrowed .
He becomes an echo of some one else ’ s music , an actor of a part that has not been written for him .
The aim of life is self - development .
To realize one ’ s nature perfectly — that is what each of us is here for .
People are afraid of themselves , nowadays .
They have forgotten the highest of all duties , the duty that one owes to one ’ s self .
Of course , they are charitable .
They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar .
But their own souls starve , and are naked .
Courage has gone out of our race .
Perhaps we never really had it .
The terror of society , which is the basis of morals , the terror of God , which is the secret of religion — these are the two things that govern us .
And yet —” “ Just turn your head a little more to the right , Dorian , like a good boy ,” said the painter , deep in his work and conscious only that a look had come into the lad ’ s face that he had never seen there before .
“ And yet ,” continued Lord Henry , in his low , musical voice , and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him , and that he had even in his Eton days , “ I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely , were to give form to every feeling , expression to every thought , reality to every dream — I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediævalism , and return to the Hellenic ideal — to something finer , richer than the Hellenic ideal , it may be .
But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself .
The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self - denial that mars our lives .
We are punished for our refusals .
Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us .
The body sins once , and has done with its sin , for action is a mode of purification .
Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure , or the luxury of a regret .
The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it .
Resist it , and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself , with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful .
It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain .
It is in the brain , and the brain only , that the great sins of the world take place also .
You , Mr . Gray , you yourself , with your rose - red youth and your rose - white boyhood , you have had passions that have made you afraid , thoughts that have filled you with terror , day - dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame —” “ Stop !” faltered Dorian Gray , “ stop !
you bewilder me .
I don ’ t know what to say .
There is some answer to you , but I cannot find it .
Don ’ t speak .
Let me think .
Or , rather , let me try not to think .” For nearly ten minutes he stood there , motionless , with parted lips and eyes strangely bright .
He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him .
Yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself .
The few words that Basil ’ s friend had said to him — words spoken by chance , no doubt , and with wilful paradox in them — had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before , but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses .
Music had stirred him like that .
Music had troubled him many times .
But music was not articulate .
It was not a new world , but rather another chaos , that it created in us .
Words !
Mere words !
How terrible they were !
How clear , and vivid , and cruel !
One could not escape from them .
And yet what a subtle magic there was in them !
They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things , and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute .
Mere words !
Was there anything so real as words ?
Yes ; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood .
He understood them now .
Life suddenly became fiery - coloured to him .
It seemed to him that he had been walking in fire .
Why had he not known it ?
With his subtle smile , Lord Henry watched him .
He knew the precise psychological moment when to say nothing .
He felt intensely interested .
He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced , and , remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen , a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known before , he wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience .
He had merely shot an arrow into the air .
Had it hit the mark ?
How fascinating the lad was !
Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his , that had the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art , at any rate comes only from strength .
He was unconscious of the silence .
“ Basil , I am tired of standing ,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly .
“ I must go out and sit in the garden .
The air is stifling here .” “ My dear fellow , I am so sorry .
When I am painting , I can ’ t think of anything else .
But you never sat better .
You were perfectly still .
And I have caught the effect I wanted — the half - parted lips and the bright look in the eyes .
I don ’ t know what Harry has been saying to you , but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression .
I suppose he has been paying you compliments .
You mustn ’ t believe a word that he says .” “ He has certainly not been paying me compliments .
Perhaps that is the reason that I don ’ t believe anything he has told me .” “ You know you believe it all ,” said Lord Henry , looking at him with his dreamy languorous eyes .
“ I will go out to the garden with you .
It is horribly hot in the studio .
Basil , let us have something iced to drink , something with strawberries in it .” “ Certainly , Harry .
Just touch the bell , and when Parker comes I will tell him what you want .
I have got to work up this background , so I will join you later on .
Don ’ t keep Dorian too long .
I have never been in better form for painting than I am to - day .
This is going to be my masterpiece .
It is my masterpiece as it stands .” Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his face in the great cool lilac - blossoms , feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had been wine .
He came close to him and put his hand upon his shoulder .
“ You are quite right to do that ,” he murmured .
“ Nothing can cure the soul but the senses , just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul .” The lad started and drew back .
He was bareheaded , and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads .
There was a look of fear in his eyes , such as people have when they are suddenly awakened .
His finely chiselled nostrils quivered , and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling .
“ Yes ,” continued Lord Henry , “ that is one of the great secrets of life — to cure the soul by means of the senses , and the senses by means of the soul .
You are a wonderful creation .
You know more than you think you know , just as you know less than you want to know .” Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away .
He could not help liking the tall , graceful young man who was standing by him .
His romantic , olive - coloured face and worn expression interested him .
There was something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating .
His cool , white , flowerlike hands , even , had a curious charm .
They moved , as he spoke , like music , and seemed to have a language of their own .
But he felt afraid of him , and ashamed of being afraid .
Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself ?
He had known Basil Hallward for months , but the friendship between them had never altered him .
Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life ’ s mystery .
And , yet , what was there to be afraid of ?
He was not a schoolboy or a girl .
It was absurd to be frightened .
“ Let us go and sit in the shade ,” said Lord Henry .
“ Parker has brought out the drinks , and if you stay any longer in this glare , you will be quite spoiled , and Basil will never paint you again .
You really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt .
It would be unbecoming .” “ What can it matter ?” cried Dorian Gray , laughing , as he sat down on the seat at the end of the garden .
“ It should matter everything to you , Mr . Gray .” “ Why ?” “ Because you have the most marvellous youth , and youth is the one thing worth having .” “ I don ’ t feel that , Lord Henry .” “ No , you don ’ t feel it now .
Some day , when you are old and wrinkled and ugly , when thought has seared your forehead with its lines , and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires , you will feel it , you will feel it terribly .
Now , wherever you go , you charm the world .
Will it always be so ?
... You have a wonderfully beautiful face , Mr . Gray .
Don ’ t frown .
You have .
And beauty is a form of genius — is higher , indeed , than genius , as it needs no explanation .
It is of the great facts of the world , like sunlight , or spring - time , or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon .
It cannot be questioned .
It has its divine right of sovereignty .
It makes princes of those who have it .
You smile ?
Ah !
when you have lost it you won ’ t smile .... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial .
That may be so , but at least it is not so superficial as thought is .
To me , beauty is the wonder of wonders .
It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances .
The true mystery of the world is the visible , not the invisible ....
Yes , Mr . Gray , the gods have been good to you .
But what the gods give they quickly take away .
You have only a few years in which to live really , perfectly , and fully .
When your youth goes , your beauty will go with it , and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you , or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats .
Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful .
Time is jealous of you , and wars against your lilies and your roses .
You will become sallow , and hollow - cheeked , and dull - eyed .
You will suffer horribly .... Ah !
realize your youth while you have it .
Don ’ t squander the gold of your days , listening to the tedious , trying to improve the hopeless failure , or giving away your life to the ignorant , the common , and the vulgar .
These are the sickly aims , the false ideals , of our age .
Live !
Live the wonderful life that is in you !
Let nothing be lost upon you .
Be always searching for new sensations .
Be afraid of nothing .... A new Hedonism — that is what our century wants .
You might be its visible symbol .
With your personality there is nothing you could not do .
The world belongs to you for a season ....
The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are , of what you really might be .
There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself .
I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted .
For there is such a little time that your youth will last — such a little time .
The common hill - flowers wither , but they blossom again .
The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now .
In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis , and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars .
But we never get back our youth .
The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish .
Our limbs fail , our senses rot .
We degenerate into hideous puppets , haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid , and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to .
Youth !
Youth !
There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth !” Dorian Gray listened , open - eyed and wondering .
The spray of lilac fell from his hand upon the gravel .
A furry bee came and buzzed round it for a moment .
Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms .
He watched it with that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid , or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we cannot find expression , or when some thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield .
After a time the bee flew away .
He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian convolvulus .
The flower seemed to quiver , and then swayed gently to and fro .
Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made staccato signs for them to come in .
They turned to each other and smiled .
“ I am waiting ,” he cried .
“ Do come in .
The light is quite perfect , and you can bring your drinks .” They rose up and sauntered down the walk together .
Two green - and - white butterflies fluttered past them , and in the pear - tree at the corner of the garden a thrush began to sing .
“ You are glad you have met me , Mr . Gray ,” said Lord Henry , looking at him .
“ Yes , I am glad now .
I wonder shall I always be glad ?” “ Always !
That is a dreadful word .
It makes me shudder when I hear it .
Women are so fond of using it .
They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever .
It is a meaningless word , too .
The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer .” As they entered the studio , Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry ’ s arm .
“ In that case , let our friendship be a caprice ,” he murmured , flushing at his own boldness , then stepped up on the platform and resumed his pose .
Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm - chair and watched him .
The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that broke the stillness , except when , now and then , Hallward stepped back to look at his work from a distance .
In the slanting beams that streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden .
The heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything .
After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting , looked for a long time at Dorian Gray , and then for a long time at the picture , biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning .
“ It is quite finished ,” he cried at last , and stooping down he wrote his name in long vermilion letters on the left - hand corner of the canvas .
Lord Henry came over and examined the picture .
It was certainly a wonderful work of art , and a wonderful likeness as well .
“ My dear fellow , I congratulate you most warmly ,” he said .
“ It is the finest portrait of modern times .
Mr . Gray , come over and look at yourself .” The lad started , as if awakened from some dream .
“ Is it really finished ?” he murmured , stepping down from the platform .
“ Quite finished ,” said the painter .
“ And you have sat splendidly to - day .
I am awfully obliged to you .” “ That is entirely due to me ,” broke in Lord Henry .
“ Isn ’ t it , Mr . Gray ?” Dorian made no answer , but passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it .
When he saw it he drew back , and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure .
A look of joy came into his eyes , as if he had recognized himself for the first time .
He stood there motionless and in wonder , dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to him , but not catching the meaning of his words .
The sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation .
He had never felt it before .
Basil Hallward ’ s compliments had seemed to him to be merely the charming exaggeration of friendship .
He had listened to them , laughed at them , forgotten them .
They had not influenced his nature .
Then had come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth , his terrible warning of its brevity .
That had stirred him at the time , and now , as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness , the full reality of the description flashed across him .
Yes , there would be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen , his eyes dim and colourless , the grace of his figure broken and deformed .
The scarlet would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair .
The life that was to make his soul would mar his body .
He would become dreadful , hideous , and uncouth .
As he thought of it , a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver .
His eyes deepened into amethyst , and across them came a mist of tears .
He felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart .
“ Don ’ t you like it ?” cried Hallward at last , stung a little by the lad ’ s silence , not understanding what it meant .
“ Of course he likes it ,” said Lord Henry .
“ Who wouldn ’ t like it ?
It is one of the greatest things in modern art .
I will give you anything you like to ask for it .
I must have it .” “ It is not my property , Harry .” “ Whose property is it ?” “ Dorian ’ s , of course ,” answered the painter .
“ He is a very lucky fellow .” “ How sad it is !” murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon his own portrait .
“ How sad it is !
I shall grow old , and horrible , and dreadful .
But this picture will remain always young .
It will never be older than this particular day of June ....
If it were only the other way !
If it were I who was to be always young , and the picture that was to grow old !
For that — for that — I would give everything !
Yes , there is nothing in the whole world I would not give !
I would give my soul for that !” “ You would hardly care for such an arrangement , Basil ,” cried Lord Henry , laughing .
“ It would be rather hard lines on your work .” “ I should object very strongly , Harry ,” said Hallward .
Dorian Gray turned and looked at him .
“ I believe you would , Basil .
You like your art better than your friends .
I am no more to you than a green bronze figure .
Hardly as much , I dare say .” The painter stared in amazement .
It was so unlike Dorian to speak like that .
What had happened ?
He seemed quite angry .
His face was flushed and his cheeks burning .
“ Yes ,” he continued , “ I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun .
You will like them always .
How long will you like me ?
Till I have my first wrinkle , I suppose .
I know , now , that when one loses one ’ s good looks , whatever they may be , one loses everything .
Your picture has taught me that .
Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right .
Youth is the only thing worth having .
When I find that I am growing old , I shall kill myself .” Hallward turned pale and caught his hand .
“ Dorian !
Dorian !” he cried , “ don ’ t talk like that .
